AI workflows
The book store database is a system built in Java that uses ArrayLists, arrays, exceptions, file handling, search and sorting that allows it to showcase its rule-based, validated and algorithmic data management. 

AI Pipeline
How the system extends the previous assignment is that it incorporates AI-inspired rule-based validation and algorithmic data processing that mimics stages of an AI data pipeline as well as classification, data validation and preparation.

AI theme
The book store database project extends from the previous assignment’s AI theme from using dynamic data storage to now using rule-based algorithmic management. That is able to validate input data cleaning in the AI workflows, search feature that is able to search genre classification to mimic data labeling for supervised learning and lastly, having complexity analysis that is able to connect for performance optimization in the purpose of training larger models.

When datasets get larger, being able to search and sort efficiently affects: memory usage, model performance and training time. Making the algorithmic efficiency more than just for academic purposes it’s important in real life AI applications as well.
